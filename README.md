Description

This application consists in a financial management tool that allows users to transfer money to other users. The API has been developed with a focus on security and reliability, incorporating features such as rollback in case something goes wrong during a transaction.

Here we have two screens:

- Login/Register
- Transactions

Running the project is as simple as running the command 'docker-compose up', which will start the API on the default port of 3002. This makes it easy to get up and running with the API, without the need for complex setup or configuration.

For more informations about the backend, access the link below in Links section.
